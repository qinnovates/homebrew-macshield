# homebrew-macshield

Homebrew tap for [macshield](https://github.com/qinnovates/macshield), a network-aware macOS security hardening tool.

## Install

```bash
brew tap qinnovates/macshield
brew install macshield
```

## What it does

macshield auto-hardens your Mac on untrusted WiFi (stealth mode, generic hostname, NetBIOS off) and relaxes on trusted networks. Trusted networks are stored as HMAC-SHA256 hashes in macOS Keychain.

See the [main repo](https://github.com/qinnovates/macshield) for full documentation.
